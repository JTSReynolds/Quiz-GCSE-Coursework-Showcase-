# Quiz-GCSE-Coursework-Showcase-
I made this project as one of the pieces of coursework I had to submit for my GCSE Computer Science. It demonstrates the use of classes, functions, file read/write, libraries etc.
The program allows user customizability on how the game is played for example they can choose an amount of questions to be asked, then the program randomly selects that number of questions. The order of questions and answers is randomised to keep the experience fun so you will actually have to remember the answers to questions, not the numbers of the order they appear in.

# How to use
Download the python file and txt files. The python file will play the quiz when run and one text file stores score and another has all the questions used in the game.
The formatting of the quiz question file is \n (new line) for a new question, > for splitting the question from answers, > again to split the answers up.
